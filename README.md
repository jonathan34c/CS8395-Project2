# üéé How to use the code

- Clone the code out of this repositroy.
- Download the vuforia engine SDK for unity from [this link](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/SDK) 
- Drag the SDK into your proejct.
- Create Vuforia database [like this](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/How-To-Work-with-Device-Databases.html)
- Swap the database with your choice
- Press play and test it out yourself üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
- To add an interactive button, add a VirtualButton to your ImageTarget
- Create a script for the button and modify it as you like.
- Here's the script for this proejct in C#
```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using Vuforia;

public class VBTN : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    public GameObject detail;
    public VirtualButtonBehaviour Vb;
    void Start()
    {
        Vb.RegisterOnButtonPressed(OnButtonPreesed);
        Vb.RegisterOnButtonReleased(OnButtonReleased);
        detail.SetActive(false);
    }

    public void OnButtonPreesed(VirtualButtonBehaviour vb)
    {
        detail.SetActive(true);
    }

    public void OnButtonReleased(VirtualButtonBehaviour vb)
    {
        detail.SetActive(false);
    }
}

```

- it's pretty simple !

This can creat 5 stars database

This can only create 2 stars database

- I tried to use the back of the book as the target image for my interactive buttom, but was limited to the quality of the image(2 stars)
- As you can see the cover of the book has much better contract and image quality compare to the back of the book
- When creating the image database by Vuforia, it would give the image a rating about the quality of the image. 
- I suggest a image quality of 4 or stars to have the optimize result.
- Therefore, it would be best for you to scan the book cover or download it from the internet to have the optimize result
